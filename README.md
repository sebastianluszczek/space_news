# Space News Web App

> This is only simple portfolio app where i use Vue.js, Firebase and MaterializeCSS.
> After Registration when you Log In, you could create, update and delete your articles or read and comment articles of another users. You might also send a message to other users (simple chat app!).
> I used Vue.js (with Vue Router and SCSS) for fron-end and Firebase for serverless back-end (Firestore, Firebase Authentication and Cloud Storage for images). Also project is hosted on Firebase Free Hosting. 
> For styling I used Materialize.css framework.
> RWD will be added in few days. I simply have to rethink mobile design of chat ;)
